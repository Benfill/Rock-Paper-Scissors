## Introduction {#introduction}

This project is a basic implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive interface where you can select your move (rock, paper, or scissors) and see the outcome against the computer's move.

## Gameplay {#gameplay}

The rules of the Rock Paper Scissors game are simple:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

The game is played until either you or the computer reach a score of 5 wins. At that point, the game resets the scores.

## Controls {#controls}

You can make your move by clicking on one of the buttons representing Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Additionally, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

- 'R' for Rock
- 'P' for Paper
- 'S' for Scissors
- Spacebar to reset the score

## Auto Play {#auto-play}

If you want to sit back and watch the game play itself, you can use the Auto Play feature. Click the "Auto Play" button to toggle this mode on and off. When Auto Play is active, the game will automatically make moves every second.

## Score {#score}

The current score is displayed at the top of the page, showing the number of Wins, Losses, and Ties you have achieved.

## Reset {#reset}

If you want to reset the score to start a new game, click the "Reset Score" button. If you accidentally click the reset button, you will be prompted to confirm the action.

## Getting Started {#getting-started}
